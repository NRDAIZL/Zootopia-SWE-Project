After opening the website, you are greeted with a home page. And once you log in, you are met with all the options included in the website. 

The files on Github are consisting of views, where all the forms viewd by the user are located, images, whwere the images used by the website are located, css, where the style sheets used by the forms are
located, and finally, css, where the css files are located.
